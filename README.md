# 📈 LSTM Stock Price Prediction

This project uses **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to predict stock prices based on historical data from Yahoo Finance. The model is trained using the closing prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL), and can be extended to other tech stocks.

## 🔍 Project Overview

* **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance (via `yfinance`)
* **Model**: LSTM Neural Network
* **Libraries**: `yfinance`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`, `keras`
* **Target Variable**: Stock closing price
* **Objective**: Predict the next-day closing price using the past 60 days of data

## 🧠 Key Features

* Downloads and processes 1 year of historical stock data.
* Normalizes data using `MinMaxScaler` for efficient training.
* Builds and trains a two-layer LSTM model.
* Visualizes actual vs predicted prices.
* Evaluates model using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lstm-stock-price-predictor.git
cd lstm-stock-price-predictor
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Or manually install:

```bash
pip install yfinance pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn keras tensorflow
```

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python lstm_stock_prediction.py
```

The script will:

* Fetch 1 year of AAPL stock data
* Train an LSTM model
* Predict future closing prices
* Visualize results

## 🧪 Extend the Model

To experiment with other stocks like Google, Amazon, or Microsoft, change this line:

```python
df = yf.download('AAPL', start=start, end=datetime.now())
```

To:

```python
df = yf.download('GOOG')  # or 'MSFT', 'AMZN'
```
